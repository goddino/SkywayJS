# SkywayJS

> SkywayJS is an open-source client-side library for your web-browser that enables any website to easily leverage the capabilities of WebRTC and its direct data streaming powers between peers for audio/video conferencing or file transfer.

You'll need a Temasys Developer Account and an API key to use this. [Register here to get your API key](https://developer.temasys.com.sg).

We've gone to great length to make this library work in as many browsers as possible. SkywayJS is build on top of [AdapterJS](https://github.com/Temasys/AdapterJS) and works with our [Temasys WebRTC Plugin](https://temasys.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TWPP/WebRTC+Plugins) even in Internet Explorer and Safari on Mac and PC.
